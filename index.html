          Oh, hello there, and thanks for stopping by! I’m Adam and I’m a web developer.
          While originally from Philadelphia, I now live tucked away with my all American dog Delta
          in a cozy house in East Nashville. Inside our house is a room, and inside that room a desk.
           At that desk is a clock. The clock serves no other purpose than to confirm the constant and ubiquitous complaint
           of my family and friends--I spend all my time coding. Delta and I stay buried at (or under) that
           desk in order to create lean and efficient web solutions. I do routinely leave the desk, room, and house
            to attend a coding bootcamp
           at Nashville Software School but when I return, I'm right back to it. I've also been a musician most of my life,
           and you can sporadically catch me
           some nights around town playing in different bands. Feel free to check out me out on
           <a href="http://www.github.com/adamsheaffer" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/adamsheaf" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, or take
           a gander at my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>. Below is some info on projects I've made:

             <dd class="project-description">
               GO is a single page application built with AngularJS, Firebase, and Bootstrap.
             It's targeted toward baseball lovers who are interested in seeing every major league ballpark
             in the country. It allows users to track their progress as they travel, make comments on each park,
             view comments of other users, and browse the cheapest tickets at each park via the SeatGeek api. Check
             it out <a href="https://groundout.firebaseapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a> or the code on
             <a href="http://github.com/adamsheaffer/groundout">Github</a>

             <dd class="project-description">
               Vinyl Woof is a mini single page app I am currently building with ASP.NET MVC, AngularJS, Entity Framework, and Bootstrap.
             Inspired by the site <a href="http://www.paperbackswap.com/index.php" target="_blank">PaperBackSwap</a>, VW is a place where
             users can give away their old vinyl records to redeem credits which they can then use to claim other albums.
             Check out the code under the hood on <a href="http://github.com/adamsheaffer/thevinylwoof" target="_blank">Github</a>. Soon
             to be deployed!
